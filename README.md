##Project Suadeo:

**Tools Used:**
Android Studio, sqlLite, mySQL, PHP, Java.  Utilizes Foursquare api for the menu endpoint.  

**Premise:**
This will use a slope one algorithm within the sqlLite local storage to predict what the user should order at a restaurant.  The device will then sync with a hosted database(mysql) via a php script to query the data in order to see any similarities between other users of the application.  
Using the sqlLite db on the device will be faster, use less data(compared to having all the data on a hosted db), and will conserve on battery life.  

**8/29/2016**
Experimenting with jquery autocomplete in order to leverage Androids location functions to build an autocomplete function for the Foursquare api menu section.
